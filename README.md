15.6 inch tablet build in LED backlight

For the tablet found at https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007343610519.html
I took the apk of the tablet and used dex2jar to extract the files.
I cant program for nothing so leaving this here if anyone else wants to make it into a home assistant controllable item. 

Also this tablet is slow. But after limiting the processes to 1 it runs wel enough for home assistant.
To do this. 
Settings -> press 7 times on version number to put the tablet in developer mode.
Go to settings -> developer tools and select limit proccesses to 1.
